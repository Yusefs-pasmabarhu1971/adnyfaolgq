Just saw Thudarum, and wow, I’m not even sure what I just lived through. The popcorn’s lodged in my teeth, my back, oh my God, the ache, like I've wrestled with a bear. Sitting here now, trying to make sense of it all. The lights were so dim, reminded me of my grandmother's attic. Can you believe there was a fly buzzing around the whole time, like some kind of noisy metronome to the chaos unraveling on screen?

I mean, what was with that first scene? I felt like I’d walked into the middle of someone’s fever dream, swirling colors and those sounds, oh, those sounds. It’s like the movie was trying to communicate with some alien species. Not sure who to recommend downloading this movie to, maybe an archaeologist from the future. One moment, you’re deep in this heart-wrenching drama, then BAM, there's a shot of a dancing llama—nonsense and brilliance rolled together like a sushi burrito.

> Halfway through, there’s this character, and I swear they're like a balloon slowly deflating. Ah, and then someone’s phone went off right during the climactic moment, felt like the ringtone dragged me back from the movie like a crane pulling a toy from one of those arcade machines. Who brings a ringtone like that to such an emotional film? Anyway, remember to watch the movie if only to understand why a group of people decided it was necessary to have a two-minute close-up on a bowl of soup simmering. There’s something poetic about that alone.

Everything moved like molasses then sped up like cats on catnip. Juxtaposition, I think that’s what my English teacher called it? Or maybe it was chaos. Words words words filled the air, like someone upended a dictionary skywards, with a splash of character development right at the tail end like whipped cream on a melting sundae, slipping slowly. 

And then, just as I’m catching my breath, there’s a monologue about bananas. BANANAS! Did I miss a metaphor somewhere? You ever feel like your brain’s a mushy potato trying to download a software update? That was me during this whole movie. 

It’s a journey, that much I’ll tell you. If I could draw a map to navigate it, it’d loop back on itself like a snake eating its own tail. But, all things considered, would I recommend you to watch this movie? Maybe. Depends. It was like biting into a jelly donut expecting it to be filled with mustard—a surprise, not always pleasant but unforgettable.
